Done
====

1. Limit sounds to objects visible on the screen (first impl., seems like objects aren't properly removed when actions are finished)
2. Fog of war
3. More music player controls - loop song, loop all, shuffle
4. Make main roads render with different road texture
5. Change WorkerIcon to use Canvas2d instead of webgl
6. Remove "visibleTrees" handling now that fog of war is implemented
1. Bug where expanding the border doesn't update the available construction properly. Flags closest to the old border remained Flags. Diagonal down-right
8. Shift rendering slightly based on height
21. Add possibility to pause an ongoing game.
