1. Bug where expanding the border doesn't update the available construction properly. Flags closest to the old border remained Flags. Diagonal down-right
2. Animation of houses
3. More sounds
4. Planer
5. Attacking - animation of fights
6. Attacking - weak or strong attackers
7. Defending - many/few defenders. Weak/strong defenders
8. Military settings - weak/strong in center, closer to the edge, and at the edge
9. Shift rendering slightly based on height
10. Make materials visible when donkeys carry
11. In-game chat
12. Finish making all react components into functional components
13. Fix statistics components
14. Divide src into sub-folders better. prepare-game, play-game, shaders?
15. Animation when trees fall
16. Quota handling for wheat, planks, and water (and iron?). Quota handling for workers that deliver directly to consumers


Done
====

1. Limit sounds to objects visible on the screen (first impl., seems like objects aren't properly removed when actions are finished)
2. Fog of war
3. More music player controls - loop song, loop all, shuffle
4. Make main roads render with different road texture
5. Change WorkerIcon to use Canvas2d instead of webgl
6. Remove "visibleTrees" handling now that fog of war is implemented
