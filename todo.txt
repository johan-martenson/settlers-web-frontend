Done
====

1. Limit sounds to objects visible on the screen (first impl., seems like objects aren't properly removed when actions are finished)
2. Fog of war
3. More music player controls - loop song, loop all, shuffle
4. Make main roads render with different road texture
5. Change WorkerIcon to use Canvas2d instead of webgl
6. Remove "visibleTrees" handling now that fog of war is implemented
1. Bug where expanding the border doesn't update the available construction properly. Flags closest to the old border remained Flags. Diagonal down-right
8. Shift rendering slightly based on height
21. Add possibility to pause an ongoing game.
6. Defending - many/few defenders. Weak/strong defenders
4. Waiting attacker shouldn't stand on a building
22. When attack with several attackers takes more than one attacker and then finally beats the home defender, no new home defender comes out and the attackers just stand around waiting
19. Stones that get smaller because of hacking should get updated in the web ui
21. Workers (incl. scouts) can't walk offroad through big stones (incl stones that can be mined)
22. Road promoted - update in the map
18. Stones that are out of sight and are removed
