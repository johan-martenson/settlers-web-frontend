Todo 1.0
========

1. Animation of houses
2. More sounds
3. Planer
4. Make materials visible when donkeys carry
5. Finish making all react components into functional components
6. Fix statistics components. Should be general statistics to compare players, and Merchandise to see production and/or inventory
7. Quota handling for planks
8. Add the propeller to the mill
9. Fix ugly scrollbar in type control
10. Soldiers waiting to fight should be facing the attacked building's flag
11. Border update when (enemy) barracks is upgraded to guard house. Also somehow enemy border disappears
12. Add skeleton decoration on the ground when a worker dies
13. Pinch-to-zoom should zoom in the game, not the full web page
14. Border markers should look different for water/land
15. Fix map loading so the default map looks good
16. Missed discovered land up-right from new guard house
  - No notification sent?
    - Not sent from server?
      - Discovered points reporting depended on order of adding military buildings. Adding one but building it after other military buildings caused the problem.
    - Message misclassified?
  - Discovery logic wrong?
17. Fix NullPointerException that happens after playing for a long time
18. With guard house, new owned land is larger than discovered land. Reload fixes it
19. Wild animals walk in place
20. Frontend sometimes freezes even if the backend is still running
21. Houses should have their doors open and close
22. Military buidings should have flags matching hosted soldiers and a cross if they are evacuated
23. Bug:
  java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "org.appland.settlers.model.Road.getCourier()" because "road" is null

25. Starting inventory levels
26. Short range for the quarry
27. Re-route cargo at full flags when new roads are built to resolve the issue
  - Re-route both to the headquarters/storehouses, and to consumers directly
  - Overload happends when many things need to get to the headquarters and something is getting delivered in the opposite direction but can't because the flag is full
  - Should cargos not be sent if there is no path without overloaded flags?
28. Confusing - flag of sawmill gets full of wood even though the sawmill has space (and couriers stand waiting and don't deliver to the sawmill)
29. Remaining stones look too buidings
30. Remaining stones should disappear when flag/building/road is placed on top

32. Possible bug when drawing fisherman action

33. Inconsistent width of roads going diagonally

Todo 2.0
========

1. Build windowing system
2. In-game and in-game-creation chat
3. Divide src into sub-folders better. prepare-game, play-game?
4. Workers should walk slower up-hill and faster down-hill
5. Workers/soldiers should only leave buildings one-by-one, not all at once
6. Use websocket from start, incl. lobby and game creation
